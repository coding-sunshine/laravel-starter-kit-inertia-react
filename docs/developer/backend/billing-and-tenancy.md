# Billing and Multi-Tenancy

## Seat-Based Billing

Plans can be configured as per-seat (`is_per_seat`, `price_per_seat` on `plans`). Subscriptions store `quantity` and `gateway_subscription_id` on `plan_subscriptions`.

- **BillingSettings** (`App\Settings\BillingSettings`): `enable_seat_based_billing`, `allow_multiple_subscriptions`
- **SyncSubscriptionSeatsAction**: Syncs subscription quantity with organization member count when members are added/removed
- **Listeners**: `SyncSubscriptionSeatsOnMemberChange` reacts to `OrganizationMemberAdded` and `OrganizationMemberRemoved`
- **Payment gateway**: `PaymentGatewayInterface::updateSubscriptionQuantity()` updates Stripe, Lemon Squeezy (one-time only), or manual gateway when quantity changes. For credits one-time purchases via Lemon Squeezy, see [Lemon Squeezy](./lemon-squeezy.md).

## Domain / Subdomain Tenant Resolution

Tenant (organization) is resolved from the request domain:

- **ResolveDomainMiddleware**: Runs early in the web stack. Resolves organization from (1) exact match on `organization_domains.domain`, or (2) subdomain `{slug}.{base_domain}` when `TENANCY_SUBDOMAIN_RESOLUTION` is true
- **Config**: `config/tenancy.php` – `domain` (env `TENANCY_DOMAIN`), `subdomain_resolution` (env `TENANCY_SUBDOMAIN_RESOLUTION`)
- **Model**: `OrganizationDomain` – `organization_id`, `domain`, `type` (subdomain/custom), `is_verified`, `is_primary`

## Filament Tenant Scoping

`ScopesToCurrentTenant` trait ensures Filament resource queries filter by `organization_id` when `tenant_id()` is set. Super-admins bypass scoping. Used by `OrganizationInvitationResource`.

## Policies

- **CreditPolicy**, **RefundRequestPolicy**: Org-scoped access; users can only view/create for organizations they belong to.
