# Settings

From the main menu, open **Settings** to manage your account, security, and preferences.

## Onboarding

If **Onboarding** is enabled, you will see an **Onboarding** item in the Settings sidebar. Use it to open the getting-started flow again (for example to review or run through it after you have already completed it once). See the [Onboarding](../onboarding.md) section of the user guide for more.

## Profile

Update your name, email, and profile details. You can also upload a profile picture (avatar). Changes are saved when you submit the form.

## Password

Change your password. You’ll need to enter your current password and then the new password twice. Use a strong, unique password.

## Two-factor authentication

When enabled, two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra step when signing in: after your password, you enter a code from an authenticator app or a recovery code. You can enable or disable 2FA, view recovery codes, and manage your authenticator app from this section.

## Appearance

Choose a theme (e.g. light, dark, or system) so the app matches your preference. Options may vary depending on how the application is configured.

## Level & achievements

If your organisation has **Level & achievements** enabled, you’ll see this item in Settings. It shows:

- **Your level** – Based on experience points (XP) you earn from actions (e.g. signing up, completing your profile).
- **Your XP** – Total points and progress toward the next level.
- **Achievements** – Badges you’ve unlocked (e.g. “Profile Completed”) and ones still locked. Some achievements may be hidden until you unlock them.

This page is read-only; you earn XP and achievements by using the app. Admins can turn this feature on or off for the whole site.

## Data export

Request an export of your data. The export is prepared and then made available for download. Use this to get a copy of the information the application holds about you.

## Personal data export

If available, this option lets you download your personal data in a portable format. Follow the on-screen steps to request and download the export.
