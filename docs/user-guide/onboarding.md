# Onboarding

When your organisation has **Onboarding** enabled, new users may see a short **getting started** step the first time they sign in (after email verification). It is a one-time flow: once you complete it, you are not redirected to it again.

## Completing onboarding

After you verify your email and log in, you may be taken to the onboarding page. Follow the prompt (for example, click **Get started**) to complete it. You will then be taken to the dashboard. This step is not shown again on future logins.

## Opening onboarding again

If you want to review or run through onboarding again (for example to see the steps or re-submit), you can open it from **Settings**:

1. Go to **Settings** (from the main menu or your profile).
2. In the Settings sidebar, click **Onboarding** (this link is only visible when the Onboarding feature is enabled for your account).
3. You will see the onboarding page again. A short message may indicate that you have already completed it; you can still run through it again if you like.

The **Onboarding** link in Settings is the same place to go whenever you want to open the getting-started flow again.
