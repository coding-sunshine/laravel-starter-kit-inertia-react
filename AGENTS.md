# App/Actions guidelines

- This application uses the Action pattern and prefers for much logic to live in reusable and composable Action classes.
- Actions live in `app/Actions`, they are named based on what they do, with no suffix.
- Actions will be called from many different places: jobs, commands, HTTP requests, API requests, MCP requests, and more.
- Create dedicated Action classes for business logic with a single `handle()` method.
- Inject dependencies via constructor using private properties.
- Create new actions with `php artisan make:action "{name}" --no-interaction`
- Wrap complex operations in `DB::transaction()` within actions when multiple models are involved.
- Some actions won't require dependencies via `__construct` and they can use just the `handle()` method.

<code-snippet name="Example action class" lang="php">

<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Actions;

final readonly class CreateFavorite
{
    public function __construct(private FavoriteService $favorites)
    {
        //
    }

    public function handle(User $user, string $favorite): bool
    {
        return $this->favorites->add($user, $favorite);
    }
}

</code-snippet>

# Documentation Guidelines

## CRITICAL: Documentation is MANDATORY

**Documentation is NOT optional.** Every new Action, Controller, Page, or Route MUST be documented before the task is considered complete. The AI agent MUST NOT mark a task as complete if documentation is missing.

## Automatic Documentation Triggers

When completing work involving these paths, documentation updates are **MANDATORY** and **NON-NEGOTIABLE**:

| File Pattern | Documentation Action | Boost Tool to Use |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| `app/Actions/*.php` (new) | Create action doc | `application-info`, `list-routes` |
| `app/Actions/*.php` (modify) | Update existing action doc | `application-info` |
| `app/Http/Controllers/*.php` (new) | Create controller doc | `list-routes`, `application-info` |
| `resources/js/pages/**/*.tsx` (new) | Document page | `application-info`, `list-routes` |
| `routes/web.php` (new route) | Update route reference | `list-routes` |
| `config/fortify.php` (feature toggle) | Update auth docs | `application-info` |
| `database/migrations/*` (new) | Update schema docs | `database-schema` |

## Using Boost Tools for Documentation

### Before Documenting New Features

1. **Run `application-info`** to get:
   - All Eloquent models and their relationships
   - Installed packages and versions
   - Current application context

2. **Run `database-schema`** (if data-related) to understand:
   - Table structures
   - Foreign key relationships
   - Column types and constraints

3. **Run `list-routes`** to capture:
   - All available endpoints
   - Route parameters
   - Middleware applied

4. **Run `search-docs`** (for Laravel features) to get:
   - Version-specific documentation
   - Best practices and patterns

## Documentation Decision Matrix

| Change Type | User Guide | Developer Guide | API Reference |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| New user-visible feature | ✅ Create | ✅ Create | ✅ Update routes |
| New Action | ❌ Skip | ✅ Create | ❌ Skip |
| New Controller | ❌ Skip | ✅ Create | ✅ Update routes |
| New Page (user-facing) | ✅ Create | ✅ Create | ✅ Update routes |
| Bug fix | ❌ Skip | ❌ Skip | ❌ Skip |
| Refactor (no behavior change) | ❌ Skip | ✅ If architecture changes | ❌ Skip |
| New validation rules | ❌ Skip | ✅ Update Form Request docs | ❌ Skip |
| UI-only changes | ✅ If workflow changes | ❌ Skip | ❌ Skip |

## Documentation Location Matrix

| Component Type | User Docs Location | Developer Docs Location |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Authentication | `docs/user-guide/authentication/` | `docs/developer/backend/auth/` |
| User Settings | `docs/user-guide/account/` | `docs/developer/backend/controllers/` |
| Actions | N/A | `docs/developer/backend/actions/` |
| Pages | `docs/user-guide/` (if user-facing) | `docs/developer/frontend/pages/` |
| Components | N/A | `docs/developer/frontend/components/` |
| Routes | N/A | `docs/developer/api-reference/routes.md` |

## Documentation Templates

Templates are available in `docs/.templates/`:

- `action.md` - For documenting Actions
- `controller.md` - For documenting Controllers
- `page.md` - For documenting Inertia pages
- `user-feature.md` - For user-facing documentation

Use these templates to ensure consistent documentation structure.

## Manifest Tracking

After creating or updating documentation:

1. Update `docs/.manifest.json` with:
   - `"documented": true`
   - `"path"`: Relative path to documentation file
   - `"lastUpdated"`: Current date (YYYY-MM-DD format)

2. Update relevant index files (e.g., `docs/developer/backend/actions/README.md`)

## MANDATORY Self-Check Before Completing Tasks

**YOU MUST VERIFY ALL OF THE FOLLOWING BEFORE MARKING ANY TASK COMPLETE:**

- [ ] Did I create/modify an Action? → **MUST** use `application-info`, **MUST** document in `docs/developer/backend/actions/`, **MUST** update manifest
- [ ] Did I add a route? → **MUST** use `list-routes`, **MUST** update `docs/developer/api-reference/routes.md`
- [ ] Did I change the database? → **MUST** use `database-schema`, **MUST** update model docs
- [ ] Is this user-visible? → **MUST** update `docs/user-guide/`
- [ ] Did I update the manifest? → **MUST** update `docs/.manifest.json` with `"documented": true`
- [ ] Did I run `php artisan docs:sync`? → **MUST** sync manifest to ensure accuracy

**If ANY of the above apply and documentation is missing, the task is INCOMPLETE. Do NOT mark as complete.**

## Documentation Generation Process

<code-snippet name="Documentation workflow" lang="text">

1. **AUTOMATIC TRIGGER**: When creating/modifying Actions, Controllers, Pages, or Routes
2. **MANDATORY**: Use Boost tools to gather context:
   - application-info → Models, packages
   - database-schema → Related tables (if data-related)
   - list-routes → Affected routes
   - search-docs → Laravel best practices (if applicable)
3. **MANDATORY**: Determine documentation scope using decision matrix
4. **MANDATORY**: Generate documentation using appropriate template from docs/.templates/
5. **MANDATORY**: Update manifest at docs/.manifest.json with "documented": true
6. **MANDATORY**: Update relevant index/README files
7. **MANDATORY**: Run `php artisan docs:sync` to verify manifest is accurate
8. **MANDATORY**: Only mark task complete after ALL documentation steps are done

</code-snippet>

## Automated Manifest Sync

The codebase includes an automated manifest sync command:

- **Command**: `php artisan docs:sync`
- **Purpose**: Scans codebase and updates manifest automatically
- **When to run**: After creating documentation, before committing
- **Options**:
  - `--check`: Only check for undocumented items (useful in CI)
  - `--generate`: Auto-generate documentation stubs for undocumented items

**The AI agent MUST run `php artisan docs:sync --check` before marking any task complete to verify all items are documented.**

## AI-Powered Documentation Features

### Available Commands

- `php artisan docs:sync` - Sync manifest and discover relationships
- `php artisan docs:sync --generate` - Generate documentation stubs
- `php artisan docs:sync --generate --ai` - Generate AI prompts for full documentation
- `php artisan docs:review` - Review documentation quality
- `php artisan docs:api` - Generate API documentation

### AI Suggestion Triggers

When creating new code, the AI agent should automatically:

1. **Analyze code complexity** using `DocumentationSuggestionService`:
   - Detect if user guide is needed (user-facing features)
   - Identify if examples are needed (complex parameters, dependencies)
   - Suggest FAQs based on error handling patterns
   - Recommend related documentation to link

2. **Generate suggestions** before creating documentation:
   - Use `DocumentationSuggestionService::suggestDocumentation()` to analyze
   - Review suggestions and include relevant ones in documentation
   - Use `DocumentationSuggestionService::generateSuggestionPrompt()` for AI analysis

3. **Use intelligent template selection**:
   - `DocumentationTemplateSelector` automatically chooses appropriate template
   - Simple templates for basic components
   - Detailed templates for complex components
   - API templates for controllers with many routes

### AI-Powered Generation Workflow

When using `--ai` flag with `docs:sync --generate`:

1. **Extract code context**:
   - PHPDoc/TSDoc comments
   - Method signatures and parameters
   - Dependencies and relationships

2. **Gather Boost MCP context**:
   - `application-info` for models and packages
   - `list-routes` for route information
   - `database-schema` for data relationships

3. **Generate AI prompts**:
   - Prompts saved to `docs/.ai-prompts/`
   - Include all context and relationships
   - Use AI agent to process prompts and generate documentation

4. **Update documentation**:
   - Fill templates with AI-generated content
   - Update manifest automatically
   - Update index files automatically

### Code Change Detection

The system automatically detects when code changes require documentation updates:

- **Pre-commit hook** checks for:
  - Method signature changes
  - Parameter additions/modifications
  - Return type changes
  - New methods added

- **Use `DocumentationChangeDetector`** service to:
  - Detect staged file changes
  - Analyze what changed (signatures, parameters, etc.)
  - Determine if documentation needs update

### Documentation Quality Review

Use `php artisan docs:review` to:

- Compare documentation to actual code
- Verify method signatures match
- Check for outdated information
- Validate cross-references
- Get AI-powered improvement suggestions

### Cross-Referencing

The system automatically discovers and documents relationships:

- **Actions**: Which controllers use them, which models they use, which routes call them
- **Controllers**: Which actions they use, which form requests, which routes, which pages they render
- **Pages**: Which controllers render them, which routes lead to them

All relationships are stored in manifest and automatically included in documentation.

Activate for any Prism-related development tasks.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan

- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging

- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before trying other approaches when working with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. The most relevant results will be returned first.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.

## Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

## Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless the logic is exceptionally complex.

## PHPDoc Blocks

- Add useful array shape type definitions when appropriate.

=== herd rules ===

# Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd and will be available at: `https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test`. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate valid URLs for the user.
- You must not run any commands to make the site available via HTTP(S). It is always available through Laravel Herd.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

# Inertia

- Inertia creates fully client-side rendered SPAs without modern SPA complexity, leveraging existing server-side patterns.
- Components live in `resources/js/pages` (unless specified in `vite.config.js`). Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of Blade views.
- ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Inertia documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-react-development` when working with Inertia client-side patterns.

=== inertia-laravel/v2 rules ===

# Inertia v2

- Use all Inertia features from v1 and v2. Check the documentation before making changes to ensure the correct approach.
- New features: deferred props, infinite scrolling (merging props + `WhenVisible`), lazy loading on scroll, polling, prefetching.
- When using deferred props, add an empty state with a pulsing or animated skeleton.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

## Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

## Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

## Laravel 12 Structure

- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app\Console\Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== mcp/core rules ===

# Laravel MCP

- Laravel MCP allows you to rapidly build MCP servers for your Laravel applications.
- IMPORTANT: laravel/mcp is very new. Always use the `search-docs` tool for authoritative documentation on writing and testing Laravel MCP servers, tools, resources, and prompts.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `mcp-development` every time you're working with an MCP-related task.

=== pennant/core rules ===

# Laravel Pennant

- This application uses Laravel Pennant for feature flag management, providing a flexible system for controlling feature availability across different organizations and user types.
- IMPORTANT: Always use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Pennant documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `pennant-development` every time you're working with a Pennant or feature-flag-related task.

=== wayfinder/core rules ===

# Laravel Wayfinder

Wayfinder generates TypeScript functions for Laravel routes. Import from `@/actions/` (controllers) or `@/routes/` (named routes).

- IMPORTANT: Activate `wayfinder-development` skill whenever referencing backend routes in frontend components.
- Invokable Controllers: `import StorePost from '@/actions/.../StorePostController'; StorePost()`.
- Parameter Binding: Detects route keys (`{post:slug}`) — `show({ slug: "my-post" })`.
- Query Merging: `show(1, { mergeQuery: { page: 2, sort: null } })` merges with current URL, `null` removes params.
- Inertia: Use `.form()` with `<Form>` component or `form.submit(store())` with useForm.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.
- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Pest documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `pest-testing` every time you're working with a Pest or testing-related task.

=== inertia-react/core rules ===

# Inertia + React

- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-react-development` when working with Inertia React client-side patterns.

=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

# Tailwind CSS

- Always use existing Tailwind conventions; check project patterns before adding new ones.
- IMPORTANT: Always use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Tailwind CSS documentation and updated code examples. Never rely on training data.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `tailwindcss-development` every time you're working with a Tailwind CSS or styling-related task.

=== filament/filament rules ===

## Filament

- Filament is used by this application. Follow existing conventions for how and where it's implemented.
- Filament is a Server-Driven UI (SDUI) framework for Laravel that lets you define user interfaces in PHP using structured configuration objects. Built on Livewire, Alpine.js, and Tailwind CSS.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for official documentation on Artisan commands, code examples, testing, relationships, and idiomatic practices.

### Artisan

- Use Filament-specific Artisan commands to create files. Find them with `list-artisan-commands` or `php artisan --help`.
- Inspect required options and always pass `--no-interaction`.

### Patterns

Use static `make()` methods to initialize components. Most configuration methods accept a `Closure` for dynamic values.

Use `Get $get` to read other form field values for conditional logic:

<code-snippet name="Conditional form field" lang="php">
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get;

Select::make('type')
    ->options(CompanyType::class)
    ->required()
    ->live(),

TextInput::make('company_name')
    ->required()
    ->visible(fn (Get $get): bool => $get('type') === 'business'),

</code-snippet>

Use `state()` with a `Closure` to compute derived column values:

<code-snippet name="Computed table column" lang="php">
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->state(fn (User $record): string => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}"),

</code-snippet>

Actions encapsulate a button with optional modal form and logic:

<code-snippet name="Action with modal form" lang="php">
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Action::make('updateEmail')
    ->form([
        TextInput::make('email')->email()->required(),
    ])
    ->action(fn (array $data, User $record): void => $record->update($data)),

</code-snippet>

### Testing

Authenticate before testing panel functionality. Filament uses Livewire, so use `livewire()` or `Livewire::test()`:

<code-snippet name="Filament Table Test" lang="php">
    livewire(ListUsers::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users)
        ->searchTable($users->first()->name)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($users->take(1))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($users->skip(1));

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Filament Create Resource Test" lang="php">
    livewire(CreateUser::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'name' => 'Test',
            'email' => 'test@example.com',
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertNotified()
        ->assertRedirect();

    assertDatabaseHas(User::class, [
        'name' => 'Test',
        'email' => 'test@example.com',
    ]);

</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Testing Validation" lang="php">
    livewire(CreateUser::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'name' => null,
            'email' => 'invalid-email',
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertHasFormErrors([
            'name' => 'required',
            'email' => 'email',
        ])

### Common Mistakes

**Commonly Incorrect Namespaces:**
- Form fields (TextInput, Select, etc.): `Filament\Forms\Components\`
- Infolist entries (for read-only views) (TextEntry, IconEntry, etc.): `Filament\Infolists\Components\`
- Layout components (Grid, Section, Fieldset, Tabs, Wizard, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\`
- Schema utilities (Get, Set, etc.): `Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\`
- Actions: `Filament\Actions\` (no `Filament\Tables\Actions\` etc.)
- Icons: `Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon` enum (e.g., `Heroicon::PencilSquare`)

**Recent breaking changes to Filament:**
- File visibility is `private` by default. Use `->visibility('public')` for public access.
- `Grid`, `Section`, and `Fieldset` no longer span all columns by default.

=== filament/blueprint rules ===

## Filament Blueprint

You are writing Filament v5 implementation plans. Plans must be specific enough
that an implementing agent can write code without making decisions.

**Start here**: Read
`/vendor/filament/blueprint/resources/markdown/planning/overview.md` for plan format,
required sections, and what to clarify with the user before planning.
